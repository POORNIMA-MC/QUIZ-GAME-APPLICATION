## Overview
#### The Koun Banega Karodpati (KBC) Game is a Java program that simulates the popular quiz show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" with some added features. The program allows a contestant to answer a series of questions with increasing difficulty to earn virtual rupees. It includes lifelines such as "50:50," "Audience Poll," and "Skip" to help the contestant progress in the game.

## Features
#### 1. Question Management: The program manages a list of questions, each with a question statement, answer choices, correct answer, and a specific question value in virtual rupees.
#### 2. Lifelines: Three lifelines are available to the contestant:
#### 3. 50:50: Eliminates two incorrect answer choices, leaving two options for the contestant.
#### 4. Audience Poll: Simulates the lifeline where the audience provides percentages for each answer choice, helping the contestant make an informed decision.
#### 5. Skip: Allows the contestant to skip a question without answering it.
#### 6. Game Rules: The program provides game rules and instructions for the contestant at the beginning.
#### 7. Winning: Contestants accumulate virtual rupees for each correct answer. The game consists of ten questions with increasing question values. A correct answer increases the total rupees, while an incorrect answer ends the game.
